System-1: Ubuntu installed on single ext4 partition (/dev/hda1)
System-2: Ubuntu installed on luks-encrypted btfs partition (/dev/hda2) with /boot mounted on /dev/hda1

Test Cases:

1. Restore a snapshot on sys-1.
2. Restore a snapshot on sys-2.
3. Restore snapshot on sys-1 while running sys-2. Verify restored system.
4. Restore snapshot on sys-2 while running sys-1. Verify restored system.

For 1,2,3,4: Create a file named include.txt containing text old" or "new" in Home and add a include filter for the file. Change the wallper for each snapshot. Verify wallpaper and include.txt contents after restore.

5. Clone sys-1 on empty disk /dev/hdc1. Boot cloned system and verify /etc/fstab.
6. Clone sys-1 on empty disk /dev/hdc2 with /boot on /dev/hdc1 and /home on /dev/hdc3.  Boot cloned system and verify /etc/fstab.
7. Repeat steps 5,6 for sys-2.

For 5,6,7: Verify /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab. They should contain the device mappings that were selected before cloning the system.

8. Run timeshift from Live system and verify that backup options are disabled. Restore options should be available.

9. Run TC-1 from Fedora, OpenSUSE, Elementary OS and Manjaro.
