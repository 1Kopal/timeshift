Description: A system restore utility for Linux
 TimeShift is a utility which provides features similar to "System Restore"
 in Windows and "Time Machine" in Mac OS. Snapshots of the file system are taken 
 at regular intervals which can be restored at a later date
 to undo system changes. Snapshots can be restored from the running system 
 or by booting from a Live CD.
