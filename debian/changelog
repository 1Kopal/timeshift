timeshift (1.7.6) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Fixed: Enumerating device name for SD cards would throw an exception while sorting

  * Fixed: Timeshift creates large log files with junk messages when executed in the background as a scheduled job, with the backup device unplugged

  * Fixed: Check if value read from stdin is null before using it
