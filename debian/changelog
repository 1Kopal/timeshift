timeshift (17.1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Added support for BTRFS snapshots. Snapshot type can be selected
  from Settings window or from Setup Wizard window. Type will be
  auto-selected on first run based on the type of system.

  * Added support for BTRFS systems with @ and @home on different disks

  prevent recursive backups which can cause the disk to run out of
  space.

  default exclude list

  '--backup-now' with '--create'

  * Console: Added option --tags to specify backup level while creating
  snapshots
